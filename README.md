# COVID-Detection-using-Computer-Vision-and-Neural-Networks

Develop an advanced machine learning based classifier that can scan
chest X- rays and classify COVID19 positive cases and negative cases.
In this project, we are going to explore X-ray images as doctors frequently
use X- rays and CT scans to diagnose pneumonia, lung inflammation,
abscesses, and/or enlarged lymph nodes and try to detect positive COVID19 cases from the given X- ray dataset.
• Positive Cases : https://github.com/ieee8023/covid-chestxray-dataset
• Normal Cases : https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chestxray-pneumonia

Please visit the python code and report for indepth understanding of my project.
